[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/tpuiexbq8hyn9rq5?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sledjama/youtube-video-downloader)

Many youtube downloader out there either has lots of ads or you pay to use some features
many of these features are already available as free softwares, well, mostly commandline based

What i have done is create a GUI that uses these popular commandline tools
youtube-dl and ffmpeg.

Future updates will include support to convert between many file formats,
extracting audio from downloaded videos via ffmpeg and support for other download sites.
