Many youtube downloader out there either has lots of ads or you pay to use some features
many of these features are already available as free softwares, well, mostly commandline based

What i have done is create a GUI that uses these popular commandline tools
youtube-dl and ffmpeg.

watchout for future updates, i will be adding support to convert between many file formats
thanks to ffmpeg.

At the moment, enjoy this.
